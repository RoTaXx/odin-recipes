    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with foil.</li>
        <li>Spread vegetables out on the prepared pan. Drizzle with olive oil; toss to coat. <br>
             Sprinkle salt and Italian seasoning evenly over vegetables.</li>
        <li>Roast vegetables in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a high powered blender (such as a Vitamix) halfway with roasted vegetables <br>
            and any accumulated juices. Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times <br>
             before leaving on to blend, about 45 seconds. Pour into a saucepan. Repeat with remaining <br>
             roasted vegetables.</li>
        <li>Pour water into the soup; add cream. Stir to combine and cook until heated <br>
            through, about 3 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings.</li>
        <li>Ladle into soup bowls. Garnish with basil and thyme, and sprinkle with crushed <br>
            red pepper flakes if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
